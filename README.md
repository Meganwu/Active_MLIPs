# Active_learning_MLIPs

# Install


# Step 1 randomly generate few initial dataset based on torsion angles and distance of molecules away from the surface
(example: ZnBr2Me4DPP majorly two flexible torsion angle)



# Step2  Train MLIPs (based on Mace here)


# Step3  Generate more configurations based on MLIPs
## a. BOSS
## b. MACE optimization
## C. MACE molecular dynamics
## d. randomly creat distorsions by changing bonds or angles from some inital configurations


# Step4 Evaluate these configurations
## Similarity
  ### RMSD or fingerprint
  ### QBC


# Step5 Construct new training dataset from step4



# Step6 Evaluate the performance of MLIPs
## STM images
## Optimization
## Diffusion energy
